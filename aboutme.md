subtitle: A always-curious, fast-learning student
---

My name is Zhaoheng Luo. I was a summer intern at Meta in 2022. I am interested in building front-end of web application and doing data science.

### My edges: a really fast learner
Two stories

1.	I knew nothing about React.JS or JavaScript before I start my summer internship at Meta. But I was able to make my first commit to the group’s repo 3 days after I joined and finish the React.JS project in 6 weeks (3 weeks ahead of schedule).
2.	Recently I have to take an online assessment using Java. After spending 1.5 hours on the Linkedin learning courses, I was able to do the Java Object-Oriented Programming problem.

### Fullstack Portfolio

#### 1.Movie to emoji using OpenAI api
A simple web app allows users to input the movie name and output the corresponding emoji using OpenAI's API.

### My experiences about backend
-	Python is my first language. I use Python to do data analysis, machine learning, dealing with database and building course projects. Especially, I have experiences of building web applications using Django framework. I also working on developing a backtest and automated trading system using a Python backend based on the AWS.
-	Node.JS: during learning frontend, I built an API proxy service hosted on Heroku (cloud service similar to AWS), using it to protect the Ajax call’s API key in the parameter of get request. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/frank-1150/Explore-California )for more details. 
-	Databases: MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB. I used those databases as backend databases for fullstack projects listed above.

### Machine learning and data analytics
### Data Analytics
I've done a lot of data analysis work, building visulization plots, most of them are used for specific purposes, such as analysing sales data of business, understanding how people travel during the pandemic time using Uber data. 
Check out more my [Data-Visualization-Demos](https://github.com/frank-1150/Data-Visualization-Demos) repo.

### Machine learning
#### 1. Analyzing and predicting cannabis sales
Built various model including linear regression, segmented linear regression, random foreset to predict sales by brand
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frank-1150/CS-148M-Project-3)

#### 2. Fine-tune FinBERT model for sentiment analysis
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a family of masked-language models based on transformers. [Wikepedia BERT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))
We found a FinBERT model ([FinBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Financial Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08097)) that is trained on financial corpus, but the embedding it gives doesn't do well in sentiment analysis, so we fine-tune it to achieve 98%+ accuracy on the dataset we gathered and augmented.

### My interest in building frontend and web services

#### My intern project at Meta
I was assigned to a customer-facing product group during my internship at Meta. My experiences and skills about React, JavaScript and HTML come from two projects:

1.	The first one is the drop off flow on this "Book now" button, for example: [this page](https://www.facebook.com/Bestfriendssalon). I am responsible for maintain the BookNow service across all Facebook apps. Besides that, I also built new functionality on the exit flow, aiming to discover at which step and when does users exit the booking flow. What's more, I built the users behavior loggings myself, and used internal data tools (similar to SQL, Tableau) to visualize, analyze the data and to give insightful suggestions for our product team. You may not be able to see the feature because it's still in experiment. I built that using mainly React.JS and JavaScript.

2.	After the code was completed, I performed A/B test on the feature I built on part of our “testing universe”, collecting data, and to decide whether we would launch this feature for all users based on our “statistically significant indicator”. Besides that, I also participate in helping my intern manager conduct and navigate through her A/B/C/D test on her features, which is a more complex version of A/B test with more than one test group. 

Second project I did is about mobile development on Messenger App, building a server-based frontend pages that can be deliver to mobile side in real time, so that we can update contents without the need for users to update their app versions.
