subtitle: A always-curious, fast-learning student
---

My name is Zhaoheng Luo. I was a summer intern at Meta in 2022. I am interested in building front-end of web application and doing data science.

### My edges: a really fast learner
Two stories

1.	I knew nothing about React.JS or JavaScript before I start my summer internship at Meta. But I was able to make my first commit to the group’s repo 3 days after I joined and finish the React.JS project in 6 weeks (3 weeks ahead of schedule).
2.	Recently I have to take an online assessment using Java. After spending 1.5 hours on the Linkedin learning courses, I was able to do the Java Object-Oriented Programming problem.

### Fullstack Portfolio

#### 1.Movie to emoji using OpenAI api
A simple web app allows users to input the movie name and output the corresponding emoji using OpenAI's API.

### My experiences about backend
-	Python is my first language. I use Python to do data analysis, machine learning, dealing with database and building course projects. Especially, I have experiences of building web applications using Django framework. I also working on developing a backtest and automated trading system using a Python backend based on the AWS.
-	Node.JS: during learning frontend, I built an API proxy service hosted on Heroku (cloud service similar to AWS), using it to protect the Ajax call’s API key in the parameter of get request. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/frank-1150/Explore-California )for more details. 
-	Databases: MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB. I used those databases as backend databases for fullstack projects listed above.

### Machine learning and data analytics
### Data Analytics
I've done a lot of data analysis work, building visulization plots, most of them are used for specific purposes, such as analysing sales data of business, understanding how people travel during the pandemic time using Uber data. 
Check out more my [Data-Visualization-Demos](https://github.com/frank-1150/Data-Visualization-Demos) repo.

### Machine learning
#### 1. Analyzing and predicting cannabis sales
Built various model including linear regression, segmented linear regression, random foreset to predict sales by brand
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frank-1150/CS-148M-Project-3)

#### 2. Fine-tune FinBERT model for sentiment analysis
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a family of masked-language models based on transformers. [Wikepedia BERT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))
We found a FinBERT model ([FinBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Financial Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08097)) that is trained on financial corpus, but the embedding it gives doesn't do well in sentiment analysis, so we fine-tune it to achieve 98%+ accuracy on the dataset we gathered and augmented.
