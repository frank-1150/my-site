### My intern project at Meta
I was assigned to a customer-facing product group during my internship at Meta. My experiences and skills about React, JavaScript and HTML come from two projects:

1.	The first one is the drop off flow on this "Book now" button, for example: [this page](https://www.facebook.com/Bestfriendssalon). I am responsible for maintain the BookNow service across all Facebook apps. Besides that, I also built new functionality on the exit flow, aiming to discover at which step and when does users exit the booking flow. What's more, I built the users behavior loggings myself, and used internal data tools (similar to SQL, Tableau) to visualize, analyze the data and to give insightful suggestions for our product team. You may not be able to see the feature because it's still in experiment. I built that using mainly React.JS and JavaScript.

2.	After the code was completed, I performed A/B test on the feature I built on part of our “testing universe”, collecting data, and to decide whether we would launch this feature for all users based on our “statistically significant indicator”. Besides that, I also participate in helping my intern manager conduct and navigate through her A/B/C/D test on her features, which is a more complex version of A/B test with more than one test group. 

Second project I did is about mobile development on Messenger App, building a server-based frontend pages that can be deliver to mobile side in real time, so that we can update contents without the need for users to update their app versions.
